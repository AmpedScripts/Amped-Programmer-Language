# Amped-Programmer-Language

## Why

i made this project because i want to extend my programmer knowledge

## Fucntions
```
amped.print(String, Variable);

amped.log(String, Variable);

runcode(String of code, Variable of code);

include(File, Libary);

constant will be a variable where the value can not be changed

variable is a variable that can be changed by calling the variables name with the new value

```
